This app can be installed similar to a native app from any modern chromium based browser (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi) through the use of PWAs. PWA functionality is currently unsupported on Firefox and it's derivatives (see [Firefox bugtracker](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1682593)). However Mozilla have said they are working on adding PWA support back into the browser so it might be possible in the near future.

Instructions to install the website can be found in the wiki
